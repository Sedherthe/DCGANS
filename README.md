# DCGANS

Generating Synthetic Images using DCGANs with Keras. Build and train a Convolutional Generational Adversial Network(DCGAN) model to generate fashionable images using the fashion MNIST dataset!

Below is a small gif of 32 fashionable images generated by the model over 5 epochs (Trained the model only on 5 epochs :( ). Cool isn't it!
